<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<h4><ol>It is actually very easy to make and anyone can do it. I like my borsch with variety of vegetables, with thin flavorful broth, lots of fresh garlic and dill. Here is the some basic list of steps:
<li>Prep veggies: You want to start with cabbage first because it takes the longest time to cook. While it is cooking, you can prep other vegetables.</li>
<li>Cook cabbage in broth with bay leaves and peppercorns for 20 minutes after bringing to a boil. 3. Chop beets, potatoes, carrots and onion in the meanwhile.</li>
<li>Saute onion and carrots in a bit of olive oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. 5. This makes onion flavorful making entire borscht recipe more delicious. Do not skip.</li>
<li>Then add beets and a bit more oil, cook for another 5 minutes. It’s called “zazharka”.</li>
<li>Transfer sauteed veggies to the pot along with potatoes, tomato paste and salt. Cook covered for 20 minutes. In the meantime, prep garlic, dill and other seasonings.</li>
<li>Season borscht with white vinegar, garlic, sugar and pepper.</li>
<li>Stir, turn off heat and let it stand for 10 minutes covered to allow flavors to “marry” each other. Add dill and your borscht is ready to serve.</li>
    Enjoy
